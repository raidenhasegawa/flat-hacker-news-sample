null,null,"&gt; That assumes the demand and the supply are independent variables.<p>When the argument is that an increase in supply causes lower wages your counter argument doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all. For wages to rise the demand has to grow faster than the oversupply. The primary way to increase demand is by lowering the price of a service aka workers get paid less.
In other words it is possible that even with an extreme amount of immigration everyone still gets a decently paying job but in the end wages across the market have fallen.<p>Whatever pie analogy you&#x27;re trying to pull doesn&#x27;t matter.
